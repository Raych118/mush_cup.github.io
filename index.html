		<div class = "headline"> I don't have any idea why I'm doing all this(laughing cats):</div>
		<p> Yes Ik it looks girly (laughing cats) and very basic with no CRUD functions ... It's a work in progress ... it will get better with time. I felt like I had a lot to write when I first thought of this idea ( nerdy and over the top I know (yellow moon)) but now lol I'm finding myself rambling about nothing at all. I haven't decided what the theme will be, I don't even know if the posts will make it past tonight, I mean I do get carried away a lot. Anyway if t dx survive, this is the official gudnyt stop, I'll find a way to navigate so all the creativity remains here and not on app. </p>

		<div class= "headline"> I hope you feel it too:</div>
		<p> Perhaps it's the thrill of something new, perhaps it's the thrill of defying boundaries and yet remaining perfectly contained. Whatever it is, I will never know, whatever it is I have failed to understand. I love the way it makes me feel, I love the way it makes my heart beat, I love the way it makes me smile and I love the way it feels like a permanent high. It's a connection I have failed to understand and whatever it is, I hope you feel it too. Goodnight Garnet.</p>

		Copy paste, I used pyCharm Idk f sublime & ol those have turtle preinstalled. Which brings me to why don't we use turtle in computer graphics (rolling my eyes) it's way easier than tht GLUT stuff(trashcan emojee). That guy shld be sued for trying to make our lives so difficult. Hai I cld strt a movement ... I hope u had a great day. Goodnight Garnet.</p>

		<p>I watched a documentary today ... lol it was fun, I wanted someone to talk to. I found one but it wasn't as fun as it would have been with you. It was about Hitler lol it was really sad so u can guess it's why I even bothered to post here. I miss you garnet, I wish u were here ... I mean Ik u get busy but I can't control missing you. I hope u're doing ok. I've had a stressful couple of weeks but things are starting to shape up. Lol met another milestone on Sunday lol, so I'm happy about that, e rest r coming n2 shape. I'm debating investing personal money in my project now, it's time. Garnet, goodnight.</p>

		<div class= "headline"> My word it's been long lol:</div>
		<p>I have been a busy bee lol but I think I'm back to regular posting, I'll try my best to keep it regular. If you still check that is lol even if you don't lol I'll still post cause Idk lol I feel like this blog is sorta my diary lol I feel better opening upt o you here lol it feeels easier than on app, maybe cause you can't reply (something I'm thinking of fixing but I'll only seriously consider it if you promise to keep this area sweet & semi-normal, it's our space no ruining it)
			Anyway, this means I have to start thinking up new content for you lol. I can't promise it will be creative cause I'm really stressed & swamped these days emphasis on the stressed. Lately I'm becoming the monster in everyone's story and circumstance will not let me change it. I've been popping pills so bad I think I've just made our local pharmacy rich lol. Anyway enough about that & I suggest you avoid addressing it, it will pass as usual. I've develoed the greatest interest in hacking tho
			not as much coding but it's somewhat fascinating. Ofcourse I might one day turn into an unethical hacker (p.s that has always been my dream job, I've always imagined myself leading a double life, running from the cops/ people, I'm weird Ik ... u're e first person I've told my real dream job to lol). Ok wrapping this up, I miss you Garnet, your voice, your face, your lips, your eyes, your hands, your tongue, basically everything there is to you. I hope you're ok & I hope I get to see you soon. (Maybe I'm diminishing the meaning of the words by saying them all the time but everytime I talk to you, I feel it in my heart and I find the words on the tip of my tongue so until the feeling fades & I can no longer say the words I'll say them & you'll hear them from me) I love You Garnet. Nyt Nyt Mush.</p>
