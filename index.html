		<div class = "headline"> I don't have any idea why I'm doing all this(laughing cats):</div>
		<p> Yes Ik it looks girly (laughing cats) and very basic with no CRUD functions ... It's a work in progress ... it will get better with time. I felt like I had a lot to write when I first thought of this idea ( nerdy and over the top I know (yellow moon)) but now lol I'm finding myself rambling about nothing at all. I haven't decided what the theme will be, I don't even know if the posts will make it past tonight, I mean I do get carried away a lot. Anyway if t dx survive, this is the official gudnyt stop, I'll find a way to navigate so all the creativity remains here and not on app. </p>

		<h2><a href="">#1</a></h2>
		<div class= "headline"> I hope you feel it too:</div>
		<p> Perhaps it's the thrill of something new, perhaps it's the thrill of defying boundaries and yet remaining perfectly contained. Whatever it is, I will never know, whatever it is I have failed to understand. I love the way it makes me feel, I love the way it makes my heart beat, I love the way it makes me smile and I love the way it feels like a permanent high. It's a connection I have failed to understand and whatever it is, I hope you feel it too. Goodnight Garnet.</p>

		Copy paste, I used pyCharm Idk f sublime & ol those have turtle preinstalled. Which brings me to why don't we use turtle in computer graphics (rolling my eyes) it's way easier than tht GLUT stuff(trashcan emojee). That guy shld be sued for trying to make our lives so difficult. Hai I cld strt a movement ... I hope u had a great day. Goodnight Garnet.</p>
